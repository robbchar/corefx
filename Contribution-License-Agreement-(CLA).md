Before we can accept your pull-request you'll need to sign a [Contribution License Agreement (CLA)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement). You can sign ours [here](http://cla2.dotnetfoundation.org).

However, you don't have to do this up-front. You can simply clone, fork, and submit your pull-request as usual.

When your pull-request is created, we classify it. If the change is trivial, i.e. you just fixed a typo, then the PR is labelled with `cla-not-required`. Otherwise it's classified as `cla-required`. In that case, the system will also also tell you how you can sign the CLA. Once you signed a CLA, the current and all future pull-requests will be labelled as `cla-signed`.

Signing the CLA might sound scary but it's actually super simple and can be done in less than a minute.
